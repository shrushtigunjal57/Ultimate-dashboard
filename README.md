# 📊 Student Productivity & Academic Performance Analysis  
### Power BI Data Analytics Project

---

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** built to analyze student productivity and academic performance using a dataset of 5,000 students.

The objective is to identify key factors influencing exam scores and evaluate how lifestyle habits such as study hours, sleep patterns, burnout levels, and digital engagement affect academic outcomes.

This project aims to:

- Analyze academic performance trends  
- Identify key productivity factors  
- Understand relationships between study habits and exam scores  
- Provide actionable insights through interactive visualizations
